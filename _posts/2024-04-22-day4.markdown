Implementing all the algorithms my own way (compared to the tutorial) and using SDL has accumulated in a lot of small differences that are now kind of in the way. What should work, doesn't. And it's really hard to debug because the example implementation does it differently.

So today I don't have any more progress, all I have done is troubleshooting. One big reason for the difference in output is the sphere ray intersection calculation. I did a geometric version (because that one I have used in another course) but it seems that it's not good enough for volumetric rendering, the results vary a lot! So the next step is to write the analytic version and hope morale improves.

I must say that debugging is by far the trickiest stuff I have had to deal with in graphics programming...
