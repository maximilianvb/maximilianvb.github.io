I made a square instead of a sphere, although it has some problems. It's more work than one thinks, because to do this volymetric rendering I am not importing a 3d model, I am defining the square/sphere matemathically. Then I compute the ray intersections with the square parameters. Very different computations from the sphere intersection!

I created some animations with the sphere as well.
