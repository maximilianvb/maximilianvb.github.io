I made a square instead of a sphere, although it has some problems. It's more work than one thinks, because to do this volymetric rendering I am not importing a 3d model, I am defining the square/sphere matemathically. Then I compute the ray intersections with the square parameters. Very different computations from the sphere intersection!

I created some animations with the sphere as well.

Square:

Spinning on the y-axis:

Light spinning on the y-axis:

The last one looks quite weird because our mind is not used to "smoke" being this static while a light rotates around it. One thing on my TODO list is to make the smoke move somewhat at the same time.
