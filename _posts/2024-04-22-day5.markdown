I did some code refactoring and figured out why I didn't get the same result! I did not understand how the Perlin noise worked, which meant my rendered sphere was not in the correct dimensions for the noise to be applied as I wanted. To be fair, I'm still confused how the Perlin noise works, I think I need to find some other implementation.

This means I'm on the right track again, however, the rendering is very slow, around 20 seconds for one frame. This means that it's not real time. I also assume that it's only working on one CPU thread, so if we could parallelize all the calculations we could have a major speed-up. But at this point in time I think it's better to focus on rendering frames and eventually compile them into a video or something, like Pixar.

If I have time to do optimization to do it real time, I will try to do so.
But for the moment, here are some results, it's really starting to resemble what I had in mind for when I set out on this project!
